        <h3>NVAO Accreditation Management System</h3>
        <p>I took part in the NVAO accreditation process as a student representative, where I spoke directly with the external review panel about my experience in the program. During the visitation, I shared honest feedback about the curriculum, student support, facilities, and the overall learning environment. My role was to represent the student voice and help the committee understand how our education translates into real-world preparation. It was a chance to contribute to something bigger than myself and make sure our program continues to meet high standards.</p>
