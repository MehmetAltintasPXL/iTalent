        <h3>BusIT-week at Cardiff Metropolitan University</h3>
        <p>From April 7 to 12, 2024, I participated in an international project week at Cardiff Metropolitan University in Cardiff, UK. Our group of four students collaborated on a mobile application focused on sustainability and social support. The week began with a campus tour showcasing modern facilities and even interactive robots.</p>
        <p>On Monday, we received program details and formed teams. Our group decided to design an app predicting power outages in regions with unstable electricity grids. We defined user stories, sketched interface mockups, and outlined the logic for energy-saving recommendationsâ€”such as advising users to charge devices ahead of an outage.</p>
        <p>Tuesday and Thursday were dedicated to in-depth brainstorming and concept development. I contributed to mapping out realistic scenarios, drafting user flows, and visualizing the appâ€™s layout. We aimed for simplicity so non-technical users could easily navigate the app.</p>
        <p>Wednesday was a cultural break: a city-wide scavenger hunt through Cardiffâ€™s landmarks, which fostered team bonding. On Friday, we pitched our concept to mentors and peers using mock-up slides, concluding with a group lunch and cultural exchange reflections.</p>
        <p>This experience reinforced quick decision-making, effective teamwork, and cross-cultural communication. It also improved my English proficiency in a professional context. The BusIT-week exemplified how diverse perspectives and rapid prototyping can produce meaningful sustainability solutions, making it a highlight of my portfolio.</p>
