        <h3>Hack the Future</h3>
        <p>On November¬†19,¬†2024, I teamed up with Quinten Cosemans for Hack the Future in Antwerp. Our five-level challenge simulated a space mission, each step demanding stronger AWS automation and resilience.</p>
        <p>We decoded Morse-code events via EventBridge with a Node.js Lambda, queried SpaceX data through GraphQL, and automated NOAA weather data downloads using robust retry logic and S3 storage.</p>
        <p>Next, we fetched NASA‚Äôs Picture of the Day and delivered it via email service integrations, troubleshooting delivery with multiple providers. In the final stage, we used an AI API to assess weather conditions and auto-create ClickUp tasks labeled for departure readiness.</p>
        <p>Despite public S3 buckets revealing our code, we completed all levels first and won a branded music player. This hackathon sharpened my skills in serverless design, error handling, AI integration, and rapid cloud prototyping.</p>

        <h3>Hack for Good (The Hague)</h3>
        <p>In the Hack for Good event (Feb¬†1‚Äì2,¬†2025) in The Hague, our team built a Red Cross chatbot under a tight 48-hour deadline. It supported text, emojis, and images for clear emergency communication. I led backend development and infrastructure management.</p>
        <p>We used Angular for the frontend and delivered a polished UI. On the backend, I implemented Streamlit on an AWS EC2 instance and ran LLaMA¬†2 locally via Ollama to avoid cloud costs, ensuring an open-source stack.</p>
        <p>A custom Python script crawled the Red Cross site to create a JSON knowledge base for accurate, source-linked answers (RAG). I then containerized the service in Docker for easy deployment.</p>
        <p>An AWS engineer later upgraded our EC2 instance, improving performance. Although we didn‚Äôt place, the project honed my skills in rapid prototyping, automated data pipelines, and teamwork under pressure.</p>

        <h3>AE Hacktopia ‚Äì Terraforming Tomorrow</h3>
        <p>On March¬†1, 2025, I participated in AE Hacktopia ‚Äì ‚ÄúTerraforming Tomorrow,‚Äù a one-day challenge on Brightspace Leuven. We simulated rebuilding a fictional planet by processing environmental datasets, designing algorithms, and visualizing results.</p>
        <p>I led the ETL pipeline in Python, cleansing terrain data and normalizing metrics. We then built a Node.js module to model plant growth and air quality, containerized with Docker for reproducibility.</p>
        <p>The frontend team used D3.js to map vegetation density and oxygen levels. I collaborated on API endpoints for real-time simulation control.</p>
        <p>Although we didn‚Äôt rank in the top three, our project was commended for scientific accuracy and documentation. The hackathon sharpened my skills in data processing, containerization, and rapid prototyping.</p>
