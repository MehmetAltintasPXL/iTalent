        <h3>Hack the Future</h3>
        <p>On November 19, 2024, I partnered with Quinten Cosemans for Hack the Future, an all-day hackathon in Antwerp organized by Cronos Groep. Our team, “Hack Tuah,” embarked on a five-level cloud challenge simulating a space mission, each level requiring progressively advanced AWS integration and automation.</p>
        <p>Level 1 tasked us with intercepting and decoding Morse code messages sent by the “Mothership” via EventBridge. I developed a Node.js Lambda function that captured events, translated Morse code into readable text, and dispatched notifications to our Discord channel through a webhook, solidifying my grasp of event-driven architectures.</p>
        <p>In Level 2, we queried the SpaceX GraphQL API to retrieve launchpad and landing site data. I adapted quickly to GraphQL syntax, crafting a single query that fetched multiple datasets. We then fed the structured JSON back to mission control via an API Gateway endpoint.</p>
        <p>Level 3 introduced FTP-based weather data retrieval from NOAA servers. I authored a Lambda script that automated daily file downloads, implemented retry logic and error handling for unreliable connections, renamed files with timestamps, and stored them in an S3 bucket, emphasizing resilience in cloud workflows.</p>
        <p>Level 4 involved NASA’s Picture of the Day API. I built a function to fetch the daily image, saved it in S3, and used a mail service to email it to a temporary address, overcoming initial delivery issues by testing multiple providers.</p>
        <p>Finally, Level 5 leveraged the Gemini AI API to evaluate weather patterns for space travel safety. Based on AI insights, we programmatically created ClickUp tasks labeled “Ready for Departure” or “Not Ready,” merging serverless design, AI parsing, and task automation under strict time constraints.</p>
        <p>Despite learning that our S3 buckets were public and other teams could inspect our code, we finished first by accurately completing all levels and were awarded a branded music player. This experience deepened my expertise in AWS, event-driven design, error resilience, and rapid cloud prototyping.</p>

        <h3>Hack for Good (The Hague)</h3>
        <p>At Hack for Good in The Hague (Feb 1–2, 2025), my PXL teammates and I were challenged to build an accessible chatbot for the Red Cross within 48 hours. The chatbot needed to support text, emojis, and images to facilitate clear communication during emergencies. I teamed up with Mirthe Reynerds, Kerim Böyükak, and Maarten De Vriendt, and focused on backend development and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>We adopted a clear division of labor: Kerim and Maarten built the Angular frontend complete with interactive buttons and message streams; Mirthe crafted a high-impact PowerPoint presentation; and I built the backend using Python and Streamlit, hosting the application on an AWS EC2 instance. To minimize costs, I deployed Ollama to run LLaMA 2 locally, ensuring an entirely open-source solution.</p>
        <p>To power reliable responses, I created a Python script that crawled the Red Cross website, extracted essential data, and compiled it into a JSON knowledge base. This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach guaranteed factual answers with source links.</p>
        <p>I then packaged the backend in Docker for easy deployment and recovery. Initial performance constraints were resolved when an AWS engineer provided a stronger EC2 instance, significantly improving response times.</p>
        <p>During the final pitch, our open-source chatbot impressed the jury with its polished interface and robust data pipeline, although we did not win. The experience sharpened my skills in rapid prototyping, containerization, and collaboration under pressure, and taught me the value of clear role assignments and proactive troubleshooting.</p>

        <h3>AE Hacktopia – Terraforming Tomorrow</h3>
        <p>On March 1, 2025, I joined AE Hacktopia – “Terraforming Tomorrow,” a creative one-day event on Brightspace Leuven. The challenge was to simulate rebuilding a fictional planet by processing environmental datasets, designing life-support algorithms, and visualizing ecological outcomes.</p>
        <p>Our team began by analyzing raw terrain data using Python and Pandas, normalizing metrics like temperature, humidity, and soil pH. I led the ETL pipeline, writing data cleaning routines that converted heterogeneous sources into a unified JSON schema.</p>
        <p>Next, we developed a Node.js simulation module modeling plant growth and air quality. I implemented core functions calculating photosynthesis rates based on light exposure and water availability, and containerized the service with Docker to ensure reproducibility.</p>
        <p>The frontend team visualized our simulation using D3.js, mapping vegetation density and oxygen levels on a dynamic world map. I collaborated on API design, exposing endpoints to start, pause, and adjust simulation parameters in real time.</p>
        <p>At the final presentations, we demonstrated our modular data pipeline, interactive dashboard, and dynamic system controls. While we did not place in the top three, our project was praised for its scientific rigor, clear documentation, and cohesive integration.</p>
        <p>AE Hacktopia honed my skills in data processing, containerization, and full-stack integration under tight deadlines. It reinforced my ability to prototype complex systems rapidly, communicate effectively in multidisciplinary teams, and adapt to creative hackathon environments.</p>
