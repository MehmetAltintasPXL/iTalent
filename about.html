        <p>I’m an enthusiastic IT student who enjoys learning by doing. I’ve worked on various projects involving cloud, automation, and security, and I like finding practical solutions to technical challenges. I’m active in the student council and enjoy being involved in projects that make a difference.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I like going to the gym, traveling, going out with friends, and discovering new things. I’m always open to new experiences and love working with others to build creative ideas.</p>
